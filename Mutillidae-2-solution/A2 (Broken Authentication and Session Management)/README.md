<h1>Broken Authentication and Session Management</h1>
<p> The focus here is to enter a restricted location. 
In real life what do people do to get to restricted location? Take an example, if someone wants to enter your house, and assuming it is locked. If not , that would be a case of "Broken Access Control" in security terms, and that is covered under A-4. The inplace lock of our house will be the first defense in place to prevent anyone without key. If the lock is strong, and the key is difficult to be guessed and forged by the thief, we can say in security terms , it represents a strong encryption. Does it mean it ensures security? No, as the thief may find multiple ways to exploit other weaknesses, break a window, steal your key, impersonate as you and get someone from the inside to open the door, or wait for you to go in and leave the door open etc. These attack scenarios have very relatable counterparts in the cyber world as well.

<p><h2>Broken Authentication</h2>
This refers to a problem in the authentication mechanism, or the lock of your house itself. It could be that it is a weak lock, or that it provides a default key which can be guessed by people trying to break in ,or that the key is repeated such that many people end up having the same lock key pair, which the attacker can break in. Mutillidae2 does not cover many other nuances of breaking authentication such as forgotten password, and response analysis, timing based attacks etc.

<p><h2>Incorrect Session Management</h2>

This refers to the flaws in incorrect session handling. Eg, incorrect session termination or validation, session tokens that can be reverse engineered, etc.
