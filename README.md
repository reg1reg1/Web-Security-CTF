# Web-Security-Writeups
Exploits for CTF's and Web based vulnerable software such as Mutillidae

Online writeups or web challenges will be put here. The wargames natas is in the wargames repository. Since web security is one of my favorite security domains, I created this repo just to store the web security ctf writeups as I will play them. Feel free to mail me at yuvraj.singh19@gmail.com if you find any mistakes. Thanks!
