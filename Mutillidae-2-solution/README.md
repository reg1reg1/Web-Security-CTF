# Mutillidae2
<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mutillidae 2 is a better and more feature laden version of prior mutillidae </br>
It is developed by Jeremy Druin. He is a Certified Lead security analyst, and explains a lot of stuff very clearly. He has a channel on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/webpwnized!"> webpwnized </a>
and has exhaustive videos on WebApp Security and a ton of other stuff.
Everyone should definitely check him out.

<h4>Note</h4>
A lot of solutions here , are inspired by my own tamperings and findings.
Please note that , for many vulnerabilites such as PHP null byte injection, use PHP 5
If you install Ubuntu 16 and above, it will ship with PHP 7.x and you will find a lot of pain trying to install PHP 5.0 (removed from ubuntu sources for 16+).

I recommend use wamp and deploy mutillidae 2 on a winxp machine
For the attacking machine , I recommend Backtrack (4+) or much better still,latest stable Kali Linux.

I will keep adding more solutions as I find them.
